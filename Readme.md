Hello, I'm Autopoietico! 🖖

Carving my path as a full-stack developer, I have previously worked with Minecraft content creators. I also initiated [Overpicker.win](https://www.overpicker.win), a website designed to create Overwatch compositions. Additionally, I have worked on various other projects during my free time. 😊

- 📚 Javascript / PHP / Python
- 🏗️ Laravel
- 🌐 Linux / Apache
